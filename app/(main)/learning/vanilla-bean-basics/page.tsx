                <p className="text-gray-700">
                    The best vanilla bean is the one that suits your needs! Each type offers something unique—whether it’s a richer flavor, more seeds, or a distinct aroma. The key is to explore and find out which one resonates with your taste.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                    Some beans are bold and full-bodied, while others offer a delicate, sweet scent. No single type reigns supreme; it&apos;s all about personal preference and the recipe at hand.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Vanilla beans come in all shapes and sizes, making it tough to pinpoint an exact count per ounce. Generally, expect anywhere from 5 to 12 beans per ounce, depending on their size and grade.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                    Larger, high-quality beans will naturally have fewer in an ounce, while smaller or extract-grade beans might offer more. Either way, you&apos;re in for a fragrant and flavorful experience.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Vanilla beans are incredibly versatile! Use them to create your own vanilla extract, or try incorporating the seeds (known as caviar) into recipes like ice cream, custards, or even savory dishes for an unexpected twist.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                    Once you&apos;ve extracted the beans, don&apos;t toss them out—reuse them to make a second batch of extract, flavor sugar, or even grind them into vanilla powder. The possibilities are endless!

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Vanilla beans are delicate and should be stored carefully to preserve their quality. Keep them submerged in alcohol or vacuum-seal them for short-term storage. Avoid refrigeration, as it can cause the beans to dry out or develop mold.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                    With proper care, your vanilla beans will stay fresh and ready to use whenever inspiration strikes!
